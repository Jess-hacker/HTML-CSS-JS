  <div id=bg-class>Life is the journey of living. We live, we lead our lives and we die. In doing so, we try to give shape to our lives. Life is not the same for everyone. Some people face a lot of difficulty with life while some don’t. Those who do not face any difficulty in life look at it in one way. Those who suffer in life look at it in another way. Life is often said to be precious. That all the more is evident through the various ways in which people try to save lives.

  <div id=bg-class>Life is one word that comes with multiple meanings and experiences. Above all life is not just about existence but also about how an individual defines that existence. Hence, it is important to look at life not just from one single perspective. Philosophers, scholars, poets and authors have written much about what constitutes living and more importantly what are the necessary items that define someone’s life. Ofcourse this exercise has been done in various ways. While philosophers would try to find the meaning and purpose behind the life of individuals, poets and authors would document the richness of life at various stages. Life is thus perhaps something that is more than intriguing
